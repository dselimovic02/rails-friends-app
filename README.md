# Friends App

A fullstack stack app that displays CRUD functionality and authentication/authorization system.

Built with:
* Ruby on Rails
* Bootstrap
* Devise

*This site is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) but is not active because I would get charged. If you want to interact with the website to test it's functionality, you can send me an email at dselimovic02@gmail.com to activate it for you. Or you can clone this repo and run it locally.*

## Preview
Considering the site is not live, here is a short preview.
